# Portfolio

My portfolio website written in Angular JS. Available to view at [mjberube.com](http://mjberube.com).

**NOTE** some of the webfonts have been removed from this repository build that are used on my website because they are licensed webfonts.

## Installation

Clone this repository in GitHub or download the repository as a zip.

Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)

Unpackage the application and open up the command line. Head to the directory that has the application and enter:

`npm install`

node.js will install a bunch of node modules, after this you must install the bower modules using this command:

`bower install`

## Usage

Entering `grunt build` in the command line of the working directory will build the application in the `dist` folder. Just copy the contents of that directory to a webserver and the application should be all set up.
